## RB-ADA Algorithm References

### Primary Algorithm Source

**Rule-Based Adaptive Dynamic Algorithm (RB-ADA)**

Iqbal, S. (2024). *Rule-Based Adaptive Dynamic Algorithm (RB-ADA) for adaptive quiz systems* [Unpublished algorithm]. Team ChendAwan.

**Algorithm Description**: The RB-ADA algorithm is a rule-based adaptive learning system specifically developed for the NeuroQuiz platform. It dynamically adjusts question difficulty and education level in real-time based on user performance through four core adaptive rules: First Question Penalty, Performance Ratio Check, Level Drop, and Level Recovery Promotion.

**Key Features**:
- Real-time difficulty adjustment based on performance patterns
- Education level adaptation (Elementary, Secondary, University)
- Recovery mechanism for users who struggle initially but improve
- Difficulty-weighted scoring system

**Algorithm Author**: Saiful Iqbal, Lead Developer, Team ChendAwan  
**Platform**: NeuroQuiz™ Adaptive Learning Platform

## Cognitive Analyzer References

### Primary Reference

**Rule Space Method (RSM) - Cognitive Diagnostic Assessment**

Tatsuoka, K. K. (2009). *Cognitive assessment: An introduction to the Rule Space Method*. Routledge.

**Citation in APA 7th Edition**:
Tatsuoka, K. K. (2009). *Cognitive assessment: An introduction to the Rule Space Method*. Routledge.

**Summary**: This foundational work introduces the Rule Space Method (RSM), a cognitive diagnostic technique that transforms item response patterns into measurable attribute mastery probabilities. RSM helps interpret test results beyond aggregate scores by identifying underlying knowledge strengths and weaknesses, enabling customized assessment feedback. It has been applied in large-scale assessments such as the PSAT and other educational diagnostics.

**Application in NeuroQuiz**: The Cognitive Analyzer component is inspired by RSM principles, analyzing learning patterns through multiple cognitive dimensions including knowledge mastery, adaptability, consistency, recovery patterns, processing speed, analytical thinking, and self-regulation.
