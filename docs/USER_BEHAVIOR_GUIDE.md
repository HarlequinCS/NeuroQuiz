# NeuroQuiz™ User Behavior Guide
## How Your Actions Influence Cognitive Assessment Outcomes

---

## Overview

This document explains how your behavior during the quiz session affects the cognitive analytics results and what data the system requires to generate meaningful assessments.

---

## Understanding the Cognitive Assessment System

The NeuroQuiz cognitive assessment is based on **Cognitive Diagnostic Assessment (CDA)** principles, specifically the **Rule Space Method** (Tatsuoka, 2009). The system analyzes your response patterns, timing, and adaptive behavior to generate a comprehensive cognitive profile.

---

## Required Data for Accurate Assessment

### Minimum Data Requirements

For the system to produce meaningful cognitive analytics, you need:

1. **Minimum Questions**: At least **5-10 questions** answered
   - Fewer questions may result in incomplete or less accurate assessments
   - More questions (20+) provide more reliable cognitive profiles

2. **Performance History**: The system tracks:
   - Each question answered (correct/incorrect)
   - Time taken per question
   - Difficulty level at time of answer
   - Level progression throughout session
   - Category of each question

3. **Adaptive Events**: The system needs:
   - At least one difficulty change
   - Level drops or promotions (if applicable)
   - Streak patterns

## Data Sufficiency Indicators

### The System Has Enough Data When:

✅ **Session Length**: 10+ questions answered
✅ **Time Tracking**: All questions have recorded response times
✅ **Adaptive Events**: At least one difficulty or level change occurred
✅ **Category Coverage**: Questions from multiple categories (if applicable)
✅ **Performance Variation**: Mix of correct and incorrect answers (for error analysis)

### The System May Have Limited Data When:

⚠️ **Short Sessions**: Less than 5 questions
⚠️ **No Adaptive Events**: Difficulty never changed
⚠️ **All Correct/All Wrong**: No variation in performance
⚠️ **Single Category**: Only one category covered
⚠️ **Missing Time Data**: Some questions lack timing information

## What Data the System Actually Collects

The system tracks the following for each question:

1. **Question Information**:
   - Question ID
   - Question text
   - Category
   - Level (at time of answer)
   - Difficulty (at time of answer)

2. **Response Data**:
   - Selected answer index
   - Correct answer index
   - Whether answer was correct (boolean)
   - Time taken in milliseconds

3. **Session State**:
   - Current level
   - Current difficulty
   - Whether level was dropped (hasDroppedLevel flag)
   - Total correct/wrong counts
   - Current streak
   - Total score

4. **Adaptive Events**:
   - Difficulty changes
   - Level drops
   - Level promotions
   - Streak milestones

### Data Completeness Check

The system can generate meaningful cognitive analytics when:

- ✅ **Minimum 5 questions**: Basic patterns emerge
- ✅ **10+ questions**: More reliable assessments
- ✅ **15+ questions**: Comprehensive cognitive profile
- ✅ **Time data present**: Required for processing speed, impulsivity, analytical thinking

## Interpreting Your Results

### Score Ranges:

- **70-100% (Green)**: Strong performance in this area
- **40-69% (Amber)**: Moderate performance, room for improvement
- **0-39% (Red)**: Developing area, focus on improvement

### What Low Scores Mean:

Low scores don't indicate poor ability—they indicate:
- Areas for growth and development
- Learning opportunities
- Patterns that can be improved with practice

### What High Scores Mean:

High scores indicate:
- Strong cognitive skills in that area
- Effective learning strategies
- Areas of cognitive strength

## Recommendations for Accurate Assessment

1. **Complete Full Sessions**: Answer 15-20+ questions for comprehensive assessment
2. **Show Natural Behavior**: Don't artificially speed up or slow down
3. **Answer Honestly**: Don't intentionally get questions wrong
4. **Allow Adaptive Changes**: Let the system adjust difficulty naturally
5. **Complete Multiple Sessions**: Multiple sessions provide more reliable patterns

---

## System Limitations

The cognitive assessment is most accurate when:

- ✅ You answer 15+ questions
- ✅ You show natural response patterns
- ✅ The system has recorded adaptive events
- ✅ You have varied performance (some correct, some incorrect)

The assessment may be less reliable when:

- ⚠️ Very short sessions (< 5 questions)
- ⚠️ No adaptive events occurred
- ⚠️ All answers are correct or all incorrect
- ⚠️ Missing time data

## Summary

Your cognitive profile is generated from:
- **Response patterns** (correct/incorrect sequences)
- **Timing data** (response speed and consistency)
- **Adaptive behavior** (how you respond to difficulty changes)
- **Recovery patterns** (how you bounce back from setbacks)
- **Performance trends** (consistency and endurance)

The more complete your session data, the more accurate and meaningful your cognitive assessment will be.

**The system has sufficient data collection mechanisms** to produce reliable cognitive assessments when users complete typical quiz sessions (10+ questions).
